# Authentication Update - Simplified for Spring Boot Integration

## ✅ Changes Made

### What Was Changed:
The authentication system has been simplified to work without localStorage or backend API calls for now. This makes it easier to integrate with your Spring Boot backend later.

### Updated Files:

#### 1. **AuthContext.jsx** (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)
- ✅ Removed localStorage logic
- ✅ Removed axios API calls
- ✅ Removed useEffect that checks for stored tokens
- ✅ Simple login: just sets user state and navigates
- ✅ Simple register: just sets user state and navigates
- ✅ Logout: clears user state only

#### 2. **Login.jsx** (`src/pages/Login.jsx`)
- ✅ Added form validation (checks if fields are filled)
- ✅ Added toast import for error messages
- ✅ Navigates to dashboard on login button click

#### 3. **Register.jsx** (`src/pages/Register.jsx`)
- ✅ Added form validation (checks required fields)
- ✅ Changed alert to toast notification
- ✅ Navigates to dashboard on signup button click

#### 4. **Dashboard.jsx** (`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
- ✅ Removed axios import
- ✅ Uses only mock data (no API calls)
- ✅ Data ready to be replaced with Spring Boot API

#### 5. **Analytics.jsx** (`src/pages/Analytics.jsx`)
- ✅ Removed axios import
- ✅ Uses only mock data (no API calls)
- ✅ Data ready to be replaced with Spring Boot API

#### 6. **Courses.jsx** (`src/pages/Courses.jsx`)
- ✅ Removed axios import
- ✅ Uses only mock data (no API calls)
- ✅ Simple enrollment (updates local state)
- ✅ Data ready to be replaced with Spring Boot API

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### Login Flow:
1. User enters email and password
2. Click "Sign In" button
3. ✅ Validation checks if fields are filled
4. ✅ User state is set with email and generated name
5. ✅ Toast notification shows "Login successful!"
6. ✅ Automatically navigates to `/dashboard`

### Register Flow:
1. User enters name, email, password, and interests
2. Click "Sign Up" button
3. ✅ Validation checks required fields
4. ✅ Validation checks if passwords match
5. ✅ User state is set with all details
6. ✅ Toast notification shows "Registration successful!"
7. ✅ Automatically navigates to `/dashboard`

### Dashboard Flow:
1. User sees their name (from email or registration)
2. Mock data displays:
   - Stats (12 courses completed, 48 hours, 87% accuracy)
   - Recommended topics with progress bars
3. All data is hardcoded for now

## 🔄 When You're Ready to Integrate Spring Boot:

### Step 1: Update AuthContext.jsx
Add back the API calls:
```javascript
const login = async (email, password) => {
  const response = await axiosInstance.post('/auth/login', { email, password });
  const { token, user: userData } = response.data;
  
  // Optional: Store in localStorage if needed
  localStorage.setItem('token', token);
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData));
  
  setUser(userData);
  toast.success('Login successful!');
  return { success: true };
};
```

### Step 2: Update Dashboard.jsx
Replace mock data with API call:
```javascript
const fetchDashboardData = async () => {
  const response = await axiosInstance.get('/recommendations');
  setRecommendedTopics(response.data);
  
  const statsResponse = await axiosInstance.get('/progress/me');
  setStats(statsResponse.data.stats);
  setLoading(false);
};
```

### Step 3: Update Courses.jsx
Replace mock data with API call:
```javascript
const fetchCourses = async () => {
  const response = await axiosInstance.get('/courses');
  setCourses(response.data);
  setFilteredCourses(response.data);
  setLoading(false);
};

const handleAddToPath = async (courseId) => {
  await axiosInstance.post(`/courses/${courseId}/enroll`);
  toast.success('Course added to your learning path!');
  // Refresh courses or update local state
};
```

### Step 4: Configure API URL
Update `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

## 📝 Current State:

### ✅ What Works Right Now:
- Login page accepts any email/password
- Register page accepts user details
- Both redirect to dashboard after submission
- Toast notifications show success messages
- All pages display mock data
- Navigation works perfectly
- Logout clears user and returns to login

### 🔧 What's Ready for Spring Boot:
- `axiosInstance.js` is configured with JWT interceptors
- All pages are structured to accept API data
- Mock data matches expected API response structure
- Error handling is in place (just needs API responses)

## 🚀 Testing the App:

1. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open**: http://localhost:5174
3. **Login**: Enter any email/password → Click "Sign In" → Redirects to Dashboard
4. **Register**: Fill form → Click "Sign Up" → Redirects to Dashboard
5. **Navigate**: Use sidebar to explore all pages
6. **Logout**: Click logout → Returns to login page

## 📌 Notes:

- No localStorage means user data is lost on page refresh (expected behavior for now)
- All API calls are commented/removed - ready to be added back
- Mock data is clearly marked with comments
- Form validation is in place for better UX
- Toast notifications provide user feedback
